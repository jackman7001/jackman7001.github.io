 <h1>Jack Caprara</h1>

Hi Im Jack Caprara from Winthrop, Maine. I have lived in Maine my whole life and didnt want to leave it for college so I decided to attend the University of Maine as a Business student. I love to do anything outside such as, hunting, fishing, sports, etc. I chose the business major because I thought it would have the most options and that I could do the most with after school.
